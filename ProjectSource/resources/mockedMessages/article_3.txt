			"translation": "<p>Your support team will be spending the majority of their time in Kayako&#39;s agent area. From here they can keep track of the support queue, reply to and resolve conversations, and search through all of the user, organization, and conversation information that Kayako stores.</p> <p>In this article, we&#39;ll introduce you to the agent area, and call out some of the features you&#39;ll be using most often. We&#39;ll include links to other articles that will go into each feature in more detail.</p> <h2>Learning your way around the agent area</h2> <p>You can sign in to the agent area by adding &#39;/agent&#39; to the end of your Help Center URL. Once you&#39;re in, you&#39;ll see the inbox for your support queue, as well as a search bar and some icons up on the toolbar.</p> <p>Let&#39;s take a look at the main elements on the agent area interface:</p> <ul>   <li>     <p><strong>Inbox and conversation views</strong> — The inbox     is the default view of your support queue, showing you all     your teams&#39; open conversations.

From here, you can search... pretty     much every corner of Kayako. The search bar will return     results from conversations, users, organizations, Help Center     articles, you name it. You can refine your search using a     number of search modifiers. For example, you can use     &#39;in:conversations&#39; to limit your results to conversations     that match your criteria.<br>     <img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://support.kayako.com/base/media/url/EbnIfnsL75VP2B5SwTwKsFRDl128Ss9X\" alt=\"animated demo of user search\">As soon as you start     typing, the search will return previews of the top results,     which you can browse quickly.
